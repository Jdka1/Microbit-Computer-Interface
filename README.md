## Introduction 🌟

The Microbit Computer Interface project provides a way to connect and interact with your computer using a Micro:bit. By utilizing the Micro:bit's built-in accelerometer and radio functionalities, you can control various computer operations wirelessly. Whether it's controlling media playback, navigating presentations, or any other computer-related tasks, this interface allows for intuitive interaction.

## Features 🚀

✨ Wireless connectivity via Micro:bit's radio capabilities\
✨ Utilizes Micro:bit's accelerometer for motion-based interactions\
✨ Simple and intuitive MicroPython codebase\
✨ Customizable commands and mappings\
✨ Expandable and adaptable for various computer interfaces

## Installation ⚙️

To set up the Microbit Computer Interface project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/Jdka1/Microbit-Computer-Interface.git
   ```

2. Connect your Micro:bit to your computer using a USB cable.

3. Install the required MicroPython dependencies on your Micro:bit. You can refer to the official documentation for instructions on how to do this.

4. Upload the `main.py` script to your Micro:bit.

## Usage 📝

1. Ensure that your Micro:bit is connected to your computer and the `microbit_computer_interface.py` script is running.

2. Run the computer interface program on your computer. Make sure it can communicate with the Micro:bit via the radio connection.

3. Follow the provided code examples and documentation to customize the commands and mappings according to your needs.

4. Experiment with the Micro:bit's accelerometer and send commands wirelessly to control your computer interface.
