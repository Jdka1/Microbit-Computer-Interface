Micro:bit Computer Interface is a Python-based project that utilizes the accelerometer and radio capabilities of the BBC micro:bit to create an interface between the micro:bit and a computer. This project is developed using MicroPython, allowing you to leverage the micro:bit's onboard sensors and wireless communication for various computer-based applications and experiments.

## Features

- Establish a connection between the BBC micro:bit and your computer.
- Utilize the micro:bit's accelerometer to capture motion and orientation data.
- Utilize the micro:bit's radio module to wirelessly transmit data to the computer.
- Display real-time sensor data from the micro:bit on the computer.
- Control the micro:bit's LEDs and other components from the computer.

## Installation

To use the Micro:bit Computer Interface, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Jdka1/Microbit-Computer-Interface).

2. Connect your BBC micro:bit to the computer using a USB cable.

3. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
   - [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) for the micro:bit.
   - Python 3.x for the computer.

4. Upload the `microbit_computer_interface.py` file to your micro:bit using the [Mu Editor](https://codewith.mu/) or any other preferred method.

5. Run the `computer_interface.py` script on your computer:
   ```shell
   python computer_interface.py
   ```
   Make sure you have the correct serial port selected in the script.

## Usage

Once you have installed and run the Micro:bit Computer Interface, you can:

- Press the "Connect" button to establish a connection with the micro:bit.
- Utilize the micro:bit's accelerometer to capture motion and orientation data.
- Send data wirelessly from the micro:bit to the computer using the radio module.
- Display real-time sensor data from the micro:bit on the computer.
- Use the buttons and sliders in the computer interface to control the micro:bit's LEDs and other components.
